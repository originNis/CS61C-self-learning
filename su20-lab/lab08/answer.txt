exercise 1:
    1. One page is 32 bytes.
    2. 2 TLB hits and 8 misses, 8 page faults.
    3. No, because the entry not saved in TLB definitely won`t occur in the page table, 
    which means a TLB miss is bound to trigger a page fault, otherwise the page table won`t be accessed at all.

exercise 2:
    Address sequence: 00, 20, 40, 60, 80, 00, 20, 40, 60, 80

exercise 3:
    Change TLB entries to three.

exercise 4:
    Px represents different programs, AKA processes.
    The TLB miss rate is higher because physical memory is shared between different programs that
    the same VPN may means different PPN, While the camera is in term of a single program.
